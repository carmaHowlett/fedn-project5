FEDN Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

Project Goal: Develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. Then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

Implementation: 

Based on user input, search for a specific place to be displayed in Google Maps. Default map is Singapore where I live.

Using Foursquare API, a list of popular places will be listed and displayed with mapMarkers. Details about each place will be displayed both in the list and in the infoWindow of each mapMarker.

The list of popular places can be filtered name/category of venue.
